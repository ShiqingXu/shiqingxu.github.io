最近看到两段比较触动人心的话，一段是来自 Why The Lucky Stiff 早年间的推文：

> When you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. your tastes only narrow & exclude people. so create.

另一段是畅销书《Outlive》里的一段话(上篇博客中已经引用过了）：

> “I think people get old when they stop thinking about the future,” Ric told me. “If you want to find someone’s true age, listen to them. If they talk about the past and they talk about all the things that happened that they did, they’ve gotten old. If they think about their dreams, their aspirations, what they’re still looking forward to—they’re young.”
